title: Call for submissions
---

We invite contributions on the following topics: 

* Inference in probabilistic programming systems and broad model families:
  * Gradient-based methods for parameter estimation, variational inference
  * Metropolis-Hastings variants with efficient rescoring,
  * Message passing variants,
  * Sequential Monte Carlo variants,
* Learning to infer: Using discriminative methods to amortize probabilistic inference (Variational Autoencoders, Deep Latent Gaussian Models, Restricted Boltzmann Machines, Neural Network based proposals),
* Model specification languages that use black box techniques (probabilistic programming languages, neural network libraries such as Torch, Theano, Caffe),
* Applications to vision, speech, reinforcement learning, motor control, language learning.
