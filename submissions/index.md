### Key Dates 

- Abstract submission: 9 October 2015 
- Acceptance notification: 2 November 2015
- Final abstract submission: 2 December 2015
- Workshop: 12 December 2015

### Call for Abstracts

We invite contributions of two types:

#### 1. Systems Spotlights and Panel

Systems developers are invited to participate in a spotlight session and panel discussion on

- Probabilistic programming systems
- Neural net frameworks
- MCMC libraries

Contributors are invited to submit an abstract outlining the design goals of the system, its intended use cases and modeling syntax. We recommend that these abstracts include at least one code example that is explained in detail.

#### 2. Research Contributions

We invite research abstracts on the following topics, to be presented as posters, contributed talks, or as short spotlight talks:  

- Inference in probabilistic programming systems and broad model families:
    - Gradient-based methods for parameter estimation, variational inference,
    - Metropolis-Hastings variants with efficient rescoring,
    - Message passing variants,

- Sequential Monte Carlo variants,

- Learning to infer: Using discriminative methods to amortize probabilistic inference (Variational Autoencoders, Deep Latent Gaussian Models, Restricted Boltzmann Machines, Neural Network based proposals),

- Model specification languages that use black box techniques (probabilistic programming languages, neural network libraries such as Torch, Theano, Caffe),

- Applications to vision, speech, reinforcement learning, motor control, language learning. 

Submitted abstracts should be 2â€“4 pages in NIPS format, sent to [nips2015blackbox@gmail.com](mailto:nips2015blackbox@gmail.com) before October 9 2015 (midnight PDT). Submissions need not be anonymized. Additional space beyond the fourth page is permitted for references, if required. 

Authors will be notified of acceptance and presentation type (poster, spotlight, talk) by November 2 2015. Final versions of submitted abstracts are due 2 December 2015 and will be distributed on the workshop website.
