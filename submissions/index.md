### Call for Abstracts

We invite contributions of abstracts on the following topics, to be presented as posters, contributed talks, or as short spotlight talks:

* Inference in probabilistic programming systems and broad model families:
  * Gradient-based methods for parameter estimation, variational inference,
  * Metropolis-Hastings variants with efficient rescoring,
  * Message passing variants,
  * Sequential Monte Carlo variants,

* Learning to infer: Using discriminative methods to amortize probabilistic inference (Variational Autoencoders, Deep Latent Gaussian Models, Restricted Boltzmann Machines, Neural Network based proposals),

* Model specification languages that use black box techniques (probabilistic programming languages, neural network libraries such as Torch, Theano, Caffe),

* Applications to vision, speech, reinforcement learning, motor control, language learning. 

Submitted abstracts should be 2â€“4 pages in NIPS format, sent to [nips2015blackbox@gmail.com](mailto:nips2015blackbox@gmail.com) before October 9 2015 (midnight PDT). Submissions need not be anonymized. Additional space beyond the fourth page is permitted for references, if required. Authors will be notified of acceptance and presentation type (poster, spotlight, talk) by November 2 2015. Final versions of submitted abstracts are due 2 December 2015 and will be distributed on the workshop website.
